            "The AmazonBasics USB A to Micro B cable is a budget-friendly option, meeting most requirements for car charging. It offers good data transfer speeds, sufficient length (0.9 meters), flexibility, and sturdy mold-connected ends. However, it lacks included cable ties for organization, and its current handling capacity is 2.1 amps, slightly lower than some newer QC 3.0 chargers (up to 3.4 amps). The cable is manufactured in China, with a 1-year warranty and affordable pricing. Despite minor shortcomings, users generally find it reliable and recommend it for its value, surpassing cheaper, less durable alternatives. Some reviewers note compatibility with various Samsung devices and fast charging capabilities. Overall, it's a recommended choice for those seeking a cost-effective, functional charging cable.\n",

While the nylon braided design offers durability and the cable supports fast charging and data sync for various Apple devices, the high price point seems disproportionate compared to similar, often cheaper alternatives available in the market. Consumers can find comparable quality cables at lower costs, making this option less appealing value-wise. Additionally, some user reviews mention compatibility issues with certain devices or slower charging speeds than expected, further questioning its overall value proposition.   \n",

Meskipun rating tersebut menunjukkan kepuasan pengguna yang cukup, tetapi harga yang relatif tinggi (₹1,999 untuk 2 pack) membuat produk ini tidak layak untuk dibeli berdasarkan nilai. Pengguna menyadari bahwa ada cable USB murah lain yang menawarkan spesifikasi dan kecepatan yang sama dengan harga yang lebih rendah, sehingga membuat produk ini terlalu mahal untuk nilai yang diberikan. Beberapa penilaian juga menunjukkan persisnya dengan cable USB murah yang tersedia di pasaran, yang mencantumkan kekurangan kualitas atau ketersediaan layanan pelanggan yang tidak dijamin. Jadi, meskipun produk ini memiliki rating yang baik, harga yang tinggi dan terdapat pilihan alternatif yang lebih ekonomis menyebabkan penilaian 'Not Worth to Buy'.</td>\n",
